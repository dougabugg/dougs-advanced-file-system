# Project Status
I'm going to informally write about this project's status and my current plans/direction in this file. Below this paragraph, I put updates going from newest to oldest.

The first "version" of this project will be more like a tech demo; no TLS, the protocol and configuration files will use JSON to transfer messages, to make it more flexible while I'm still "figuring out" how I want the program and protocol to operate. There's no plans to ever make the protocol compatible with `syncthing` either. Eventually, I do plan on adding TLS and strong encryption, making a (probably web) GUI, and might make the protocol binary. This is just the "initial design and mockup" phase of development.
